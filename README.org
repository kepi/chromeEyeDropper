#+TITLE: Eye Dropper browser extension

*Eye Dropper* is web browser extension which helps you pick and manage palettes
of colors from web pages or color picker. It currently works in Chromium and
Google Chrome™.

You can find more info, help and FAQ at [[https://eyedropper.org][homepage]].

* Features

Open the extension to bring up a pop-up menu.
Click "Pick color from web page" and then click anywhere on the page to store the color in your palette.

You can also click the "Color Picker" tab to view a color picker.
You can view the hex values for any color and add any color to your palette.

* Development Setup

1. Clone the repository from GitHub ~git clone <repository-url>~

2. Make sure you have node and yarn installed. If you do not have yarn, you can install it from npm using: ~npm install --global yarn~

3. Install all dependencies ~yarn install~

4. Run the build command ~npm run build:dev~. There should be a new file in the repo labeled "dist".

5. Go to Google Chrome: Extensions > Manage Extensions. Click the switch labeled "Developer mode". Click the "Load unpacked" button that appears.

6. Select the "dist" folder inside your local repository. The extension will now be added to your extensions list.

The dist folder will contain the ~manifest.json~ file, which will contain important information about the extension.
Notably, it lists ~popup.html~ (located in the ~public~ directory) as the default popup browser action.
This is where the main structure of the extension popup is defined.

Other HTML pages, such as the page for the extension settings can be found in the ~public~ directory (options.html).

JavaScript and TypeScript scripts are located in the ~src~ directory.
This includes the script background.js, which stores state information for the extension in a background page that is loaded when the extension is initialized.

** Testing

Tests are defined in ~src/__tests__~

Run tests by installing dependencies and using: ~npm run test~
